Setup
=============

Install Bitcoin Core - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases

Follow Ethereum installation guide from /ethereum

There is no need to set up Factom as by default anchormaker is using the public server. If you want to run it locally, set it up as usual and update the anchormaker.conf as needed.
